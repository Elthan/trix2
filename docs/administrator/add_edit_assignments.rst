Add/edit assignments
####################

From the trix frontpage, select **Administer** in the page header.

If you have access to more than one course,
the next page will ask you to select which one you want to administer. If you have
access to only one course, you will be redirected to the administrator pages for that course.

Select **Assignments** from the left hand menu.


Create an assignment
====================
Click the **Create** button at the top of the page. Select a title, assignment text and optionally solution.
You can read more about tagging below, and you can leave that field blank for now.


Edit an assignment
==================
From the assignment overview, browse or search for the assignment you want to edit. Click the **Edit** button
in the first column below the assignment title.


Tagging
=======
Assignments can be tagged. How you structure your tags is something you and other course administrators need to
agree on. Try to use tags that make it easy for users to filter out a useful subset of assignments.

If you want to link to a set of tags and provide a title and description for the page you link to, use the
**Permalink** app in the left side menu.
