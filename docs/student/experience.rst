Experience and levels
#####################

When you are logged in to Trix you will be able to earn experience and
advance your levels as you progress through assignments.
Solving an assignment gives you experience equal to the stated points on the
assignment.
Experience is earned towards tags. This means that when you solve an assignment
and that assignment has the tags "python" and "for-loops" you will gain experience
towards those subjects.
Your level is then calculated from the experience you have, based on the currently
selected tags. Example: if you have 30 points in *\"python\"* and 20 points in
*\"for-loops\"* and your level is 3, then you then filter out *\"for-loops\"*
you will now have 30 points and be level 2.
This is to represent your knowledge in a specific subject since knowledge about one
subject does not necessarily translate to knowledge about another.
