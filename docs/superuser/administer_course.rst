After you haved logged in to the Trix, go to ``<domain-where-you-host-trix>/admin/``. So if trix is hosted at
``trix.ifi.uio.no``, type in ``trix.ifi.uio.no/admin/`` in the address bar of your browser.

The page you will see lists every entity in the system
that you can manage and edit. Be careful since all changes
are stored directly in the database.
